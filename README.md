🛠️ Design Patterns Used

Factory Pattern
Implemented in theRoomFactory class which creates different types of rooms
Used to create different room types (Regular, Treasure, Monster, Puzzle, etc.)
Encapsulates room creation logic and provides a centralized way to create room objects
Strategy Pattern
Found in MagicStrategy
Implements combat behavior through theCombatStrategy interface
Allows for different combat strategies to be swapped at runtime
Observer Pattern
Implemented through PuzzleSubject
Used for puzzle-related notifications
Puzzle rooms notify players (observers) of puzzle-related events
Methods include addObserver, removeObserver, and notifyObservers
Template Method Pattern
Seen in Puzzle abstract class
Defines the skeleton of puzzle operations
Subclasses can override specific methods while keeping the basic algorithm structure
State Pattern
Hints of this pattern in trap implementation (reference to HiddenTrapState in Trap.java )

Manages different states of traps (hidden, revealed, triggered)

Factory Pattern handles room creation

Strategy Pattern manages combat mechanics

Observer Pattern handles puzzle events

Template Method Pattern standardizes puzzle implementation

State Pattern manages trap states This combination of patterns provides good separation of concerns, maintainability, and extensibility to our game's codebase.
